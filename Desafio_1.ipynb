        "Cambios en stop_words (None, english), min_df (1, 2) y max_df (1.0, 0.9, 0.8) producen variaciones pequeñas en el F1-macro (todas las entradas están muy cerca de 0.70). Eso muestra que el rendimiento se estabiliza alrededor de 0.69–0.70, y que una vez elegido correctamente el tipo de modelo (ComplementNB + TF-IDF), los ajustes finos del vectorizador mejoran poco.\n",

        "La mejor combinación tiene use_idf=False, es decir, TF normalizado pero sin el factor IDF. Otras combinaciones con use_idf=True aparecen también en el top 25 con F1 muy similar. Esto indica que la normalización y la distribución de términos ya son suficientemente informativas, y el aporte del IDF es menor.\n",
